## PANDAS GROUPED DATA-FRAME PLOTTING TOOL.


> NOTE: The library is still a work in progress, so significant api changes should still be anticipated.



`gdfplot` library provides a convenience tool for plotting grouped pandas data-frame tables (e.i. data frames with `MultiIndex`) . The idea is similar to that of the `seaborn` way, where one can indicate columns with categorical data for creating sub-plots. In contrast to `seaborn`, which works on non-grouped data frames, `gdfplot` can plot multi-index tables directly and thus gives users flexibility to calculate the metrics with whatever means necessary.

This greatly simplifies the process, when the desired metrics must be calculated differently than, say, standard deviation. For example,
